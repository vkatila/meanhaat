        There are several ways you can travel to relatively close main towns such as Kemi, Tornio and Rovaniemi, 
        but getting from those places to the wedding destination can be trickier. Here you can read information about some  
        options. You can also find a map at the end of this page.

      <p>
        Please note that Ylitornio mentioned below is 10km from the church and 20km from the reception venue.
