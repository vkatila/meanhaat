      </p>

      <h2>Date & Location</h2>
      <p>25 July 2026</p>
      <p><strong>Ceremony:</strong> Matarengi Church at 15:00 (Finnish time)</p>
      <p><strong>Reception:</strong> Lapland View Lodge</p>

      <h3>Matarengi Church</h3>
      <img class="content-img" src="images/Kyrka.jpg" alt="Matarengi Church">
      <p>
        Matarengi Church (Swedish: Övertorneå kyrka) is located in the center of Övertorneå in northern Sweden. 
        This beautiful historic church was built between 1735 and 1737 and is one of the best-preserved 18th-century 
        churches in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
      The church’s timeless atmosphere, complemented by Sweden’s oldest pipe organ still in use, 
      creates a dignified and memorable setting for the wedding ceremony.
      </p>

      <h3>Lapland View Lodge</h3>
      <img class="content-img" src="images/laplandviewlodge.jpg" alt="Lapland View Lodge">
      <p>
        Lapland View Lodge is located on Luppioberget hill, just outside Övertorneå. Built in harmony with the 
        surrounding nature, this scenic hotel is open year-round and offers a stunning setting for a wedding celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two main buildings house the reception, restaurant, bar, and a cozy lounge with a fireplace. 
        Adjacent terraces provide beautiful views over the surrounding landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The restaurant serves dishes prepared with locally sourced ingredients. 
        The hotel buildings, spa area, and 40 cabin accommodations feature large windows that offer 
        breathtaking views over the Tornio River Valley and the vast northern scenery.
      </p>

      <h3>Why especially here?</h3>
      <p>
        Mount Luppio is not only the childhood hiking destination of Satu, but it also perfectly mirrors Ville's inner landscape with its views of the 
        Tornionjoki River and the surrounding hills. Additionally, it is located almost exactly halfway between the childhood homes of the couple 
        (Satu 67 km and Ville 62 km), making it a pretty good compromise in terms of location!
      </p>

      <h2>How do I get there?</h2>
